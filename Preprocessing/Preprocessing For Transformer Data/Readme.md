Run Preprocessing Script

Navigate to the Preprocessing/ directory:

cd Preprocessing

Execute the preprocessing script:

python preprocessing.py --output_path <output_directory>

Note: Update the paths in the script to point to the data created during the previous data processing steps. Ensure that the raw datasets (e.g., Yelp, Amazon reviews) are preprocessed and saved in the correct format as per the project requirements.
